			<h4>Coca-Cola, MLB Have a Refreshing Partnership in Store</h4>
			<p>In April, Coca-Cola announced a new partnership with MLB to become its official soft drink partner. Since then, both parties have worked together to develop opportunities for fans to enjoy the new relationship both inside and outside the ballpark.

“We looked at the landscape and as we examined the soft-drink category, we found we were looking for two things in a partner,” said Noah Garden, executive vice president, business, Major League Baseball. “One is a brand that shares the same values as our brand... There’s baseball, apple pie and Coke – so that lines up very well.
“The other is that we want partners who are focused on activating. And looking at what Coke has done locally with our clubs, they’ve done a good job of putting together some great programs which have resonated locally. It just made sense to do something to amplify it nationally.”
For more than a century, Coke has been connected to America’s pastime, with advertising featuring players that dates back to 1903. From Satchel Paige to Willie Mays, and more recently, David Ortiz to Joey Votto, Coke has helped celebrate the greatness of the game and its players.</p>

			<h4>Coke Zero Sugar Hooks Up With Tinder in Norway</h4>
			<p>With its sleek pack and great taste, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar is cool and irresistible. It's the perfect companion for any occasion.So, if you came across Coke Zero Sugar in the dating app Tinder, would you swipe left or right?Right, of course.
Which is why Coca-Cola Norway had the idea to team up with Tinder to connect with the app's primarly 20-something audience, encouraging them to try the drink's great new taste.
The team set up a branded profile for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar that can be matched with subscribers. If users like what they see and want to take it further, they swipe right, receiving a coupon for a free 500-ml bottle of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar.
The activation was an instant hit, generating 218,000 impressions, with an engagement rate of 14.3 percent (the average engagement rate benchmark is 8 percent). More than 40 percent of Tinder users in Norway clicked through, which is six times the average click through rate.</p>

<h4>Dispensing Refreshment: These Innovations Have Helped Spread the Enjoyment of Coca-Cola Through the Years</h4>
	<p>From the syrup urns of the late 1800s to soda fountains in space, Coca-Cola has continuously revolutionized the art of refreshing the world, one drink at a time. Critical to achieving this mission are the vessels in which the products are delivered. In this photo gallery, go on a visual journey through history, exploring the ways Coca-Cola has dispensed beverages since Dr. John Pemberton crafted the secret formula more than 130 years ago. Beginning in 1896, the syrup urn was part of a premium program for dealers who bought more than 50 gallons of Coca-Cola syrup per year. President Asa Candler created the promotion to incentivize organizations that served the beverage and to market the brand. The urns were made of porcelain, a porous material that absorbed the coloring from the syrup over time so the fountains turned from white to brown after much use. Large-scale bottling was made possible in 1899, when Ben Thomas and Joseph B. Whitehead of Chattanooga, Tennessee, secured the exclusive rights to bottle and sell Coca-Cola, practically throughout the United States. With contract in hand, they joined another Chattanooga bottler, John T. Lupton and began to develop what is today the global Coca-Cola bottling system. The patent for Coca-Cola’s iconic contour bottle was filed by Alexander Samuelson of the CJ Root Glass Company in November 1915. </p>
