			<h4>About Us</h4>
			<p>The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, refreshing consumers with more than 500 sparkling and still brands and nearly 3,900 beverage choices.

Led by Coca-Cola, one of the world's most valuable and recognizable brands, our company’s portfolio features 21 billion-dollar brands, 19 of which are available in reduced-, low- or no-calorie options. These brands include Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero, Fanta, Sprite, Dasani, vitaminwater, Powerade, Minute Maid, Simply, Del Valle, Georgia and Gold Peak. Through the world's largest beverage distribution system, we are the No. 1 provider of both sparkling and still beverages. More than 1.9 billion servings of our beverages are enjoyed by consumers in more than 200 countries each day. </p>
			<h4>Our Coca-Cola Journey</h4>
			<p>On Nov. 12, 2012, The Coca-Cola Company dove headfirst into the unchartered waters of brand journalism by reimagining our corporate website as a dynamic digital magazine and owned media channel. Inspired by leading online publishers and powered by social media, the pioneering storytelling brings the compelling stories behind our company and brands – who we are, what we do and why we do it – to the forefront through a digital publishing experience designed to inspire, educate and provoke action. We made this big bet in digital content because we believed – and still believe – that authentic stories matter, that exceptional writing and visuals win the day, and that building a global digital newsroom and real-time PR tool could transform how we engage with all readers – fans, employees, stakeholders, critics and more.

In addition to in-depth, magazine-style feature stories brought to life with compelling photography, video and audio, Journey also includes eye-catching infographics and user-generated content (UGC). And while our site continues to house corporate content such as a press center, company reports, investor information, job postings and executive bios, our design and editorial focus more closely resemble a digital magazine than a company website.

Coca-Cola Journey makes (and sometimes breaks) Coca-Cola news, bringing to life the stories bubbling just beneath the surface of our brands and business. We amplify – and add an editorial voice to – our marketing campaigns and sponsorship assets. We champion our culture, humanize our company, and find fresh ways to tell our sustainability and innovation stories. We celebrate our past, present and future. And we capitalize on pop culture moments and real-time opportunities.</p>
